question2:
1. Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout?
setTimeout: schedules a callback to run after a specific time, the functions are registered in
the timer phase of the event loop.
setImmediate: schedules a callback to run at check phase of the event loop after I/O events' callbacks.
if we have a case that we hava a Node.js server that need to process a large amount of data received from a client.
and we should ensure that server remains responsive and doesn't block other incoming requests while processing
this data. in this case, we will use setImmediate.

2.Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate?
 process.nextTick allows for immediate execution of callbacks, with higher priority and potential recursive deferral,
the nexttick queue is completely drained on each pass of the event loop before additioanl I/O is processed. as a result,
recursively setting nextTick callbacks will block any I/O from happening,just like a while(true)loop.
 while"setImmediate" schedules callbacks to be executed in the next iteration of the event loop,after I/O events'callbacks

3.Does Node.js has window object?
No.
